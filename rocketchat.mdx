# Rocket Chat E2E Encryption
---
### Rocket Chat E2E from User POV
  - Private messages between two users can be encrypted
  - Group chats between multiple users can be encrypted
---
### Rocket Chat Basic Encryption Details
  - AES-CBC symmetric cipher with 128-bit `encKey` is used to encrypt message
  - RSA 2048-bit keys (`rsaPrivKey`, `rsaPubKey`) generated for each user to distribute `encKey`
  - PBKDF2 is used as KDF to derive client symmetric key `masterKey`
---
### Rocket Chat E2E Impl Details
1. First derive `masterKey` from user password with PBKDF2:

```jsx
  const iterations = 1000;
  const baseKey = await importRawKey(toArrayBuffer(password));
  const masterKey = crypto.subtle.deriveKey(
    { name: 'PBKDF2', salt, iterations, hash: 'SHA-256' },
    baseKey,
    { name: 'AES-CBC', length: 256 }, true, keyUsages);
```

2. Generate RSA keys in the browser
```jsx
export async function generateRSAKey() {
	return await crypto.subtle.generateKey(
    { name: 'RSA-OAEP', modulusLength: 2048,
    publicExponent: new Uint8Array([0x01, 0x00, 0x01]),
    hash: { name: 'SHA-256' } },
    true, ['encrypt', 'decrypt']);
}
```
